# Description
An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written (one by one) in a script or a programming language, without being previously compiled into a machine language program as needed, normally in this process they do not save the result of such instruction translation, this differentiates it from assemblers and compilers. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
